# ConvNetQuake - A Pytorch implementation
This is a re-implementation of [ConvNetQuake](https://github.com/tperol/ConvNetQuake) using PyTorch. It serves as a personal practice and hopefully help others who are more familiar with PyTorch/Torch than TensorFlow, which is the platform ConvNetQuake was originally implemented. Note that there is no new design or ideals in this repo. If there is any different behavior between these two repos, it is mostly likely due to my lack of ability to mimicing their code or the natural difference between TensorFlow and PyTorch.
